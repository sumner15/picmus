# PICMUS framework #

An open data and open source MATLAB toolbox for the evaluation of the performance of methods designed for the reconstruction of ultrasound images from the transmission of steered plane-waves. The PICMUS project is developed as a joint effort of:
 
* [Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging of NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/isb), and
* [CREATIS Laboratory of the University of Lyon](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/site7/en).

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just clone the repository and add the folder (without subfolders) to MATLAB's path

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Olivier Bernard <olivier.bernard@insa-lyon.fr>
* Alfonso Rodriguez-Molares <alfonso.r.molares@ntnu.no>,


Collaborators:
